# Deploy SOSM

This guide explains how to **deploy an empty SOSM instance** to a prepared development environment. If the **development environment** is not yet configured, see [setupEnvironment.md](./setupEnvironment.md). Once SOSM is deployed, it can be populated with [test data](./deployTestData.md), if required.
